### WP3 – Advanced material models

**Leader**: Israel García (Universidad de Sevilla)

**Participants**: US

**Goal**: Develop general thermomechanical material models that incorporate fracture and fatigue mechanisms, suitable for HPC.

**Tasks include**:
- Literature review and analysis of computational challenges
- Thermomechanical coupling and superplasticity modeling
- Phase-field damage modeling
- Analysis of solver interactions and PDE characteristics
- Validation through benchmark tests
