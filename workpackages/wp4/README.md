### WP4 – Failure across scales in thermoplastic composites

**Leader**: Israel García (Universidad de Sevilla), Adrià Quintanas (BSC), María Teresa Aranda (US).

**Participants**: US, BSC.

**Goal**: Understand initiation and propagation of damage in long-fiber reinforced thermoplastics across scales, with simulations validated by experiments.

**Tasks include**:
- Review of microscale failure mechanisms
- Static and fatigue simulations of detailed 3D microstructures
- Generation of open benchmark datasets
- Experimental validation with high-resolution CT at Universidad de Sevilla
