### WP2 – Scalable and robust linear and non-linear solvers

**Leader**: Ricard Borrell (BSC), Adrià Quintanas (BSC), Israel García (US)

**Participants**: BSC, US

**Goal**: Improve robustness and efficiency of Newton-based solvers tailored for large-scale solid mechanics problems on Exascale systems.

**Tasks include**:
- Inexact Newton-Krylov solvers
- Globalization strategies (line-search, trust-region, homotopy)
- Preconditioners (inverse, scalable, heterogeneous)
- Jacobian-Free Newton-Krylov methods
- Integration with Alya and MaPHyS
