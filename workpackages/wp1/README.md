### WP1 – Development of Exascale software

**Leader**: Ricard Borrell (BSC)

**Participants**: BSC

**Goal**: High-performance implementation of new algorithms and methods developed in WP2 and WP3, integrated into Alya. Focuses on modularity, performance portability, and optimization across cutting-edge architectures (CPU, GPU, FPGA).

**Tasks include**:
- Software refactoring and modularization
- Performance benchmarking and test-driven development
- Node-level performance optimization
- System-level scalability and strong/weak scaling on EuroHPC platforms
